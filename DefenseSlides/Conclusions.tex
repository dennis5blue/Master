\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
	\myItem For effectively serving multi-camera networks, we should focus on the ``video data'' instead of individual cameras
	\myItem Correlated image gathering via overhearing can reduce the amount of bits required to be transmitted
	\begin{itemize}
		\mySubItem $11 \%$ performance gain for BB algorithm
		\mySubItem $10 \%$ performance gain for graph approximation method
	\end{itemize}
	\myItem If a proper criterion for correlation estimation is applied, our proposed image gathering scheme via overhearing can fit in the condition of real-world video applications.
