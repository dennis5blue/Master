\begin{frame}{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\myItem We consider a simple transmission scheme without inter-cluster interference, where the consideration of inter-cluster interference can be adopted in the problem
	\myItem We deal with the selection of I-frame cameras, where the transmission schedule of remaining P-frame cameras can be investigated
	\myItem We discuss the criterion for correlation re-estimation, where the computational complexity for generating cost matrix can be further reduced
