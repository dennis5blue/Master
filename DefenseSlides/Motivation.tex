\begin{frame}{Motivation}
%
\begin{itemize}
	\myItem Limitation for available radio resource
	\begin{itemize}
		\mySubItem Data quantity for multimedia applications are often much more larger than conventional scalar sensor networks
		\mySubItem A large amount of cameras have to share the radio resource with human devices
	\end{itemize}
	\myItem Inter-view correlation
	\begin{itemize}
		\mySubItem Nearby cameras observing the same area might produce correlated video streams
		\mySubItem Multiview video coding (MVC) technique can be exploited to remove \emph{inter-view correlation}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Due to the resource limitation and video correlation, we should focus on serving the ``data'' instead of individual cameras
