\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec::conclusion}
In this paper, we have investigated the problem of correlated data gathering for wireless multi-camera networks.
We have leveraged the fact that in many deployment scenarios multiple cameras may be deployed in a neighborhood area with overlapping perspectives of the street views.
Therefore, we have proposed an overhearing source coding scheme, which is able to reduce the amount of required encode bits by exploiting the correlation among cameras. 
We have designed an algorithm based on branch-and-bound for solving the optimization problem of minimizing the amount of required transmission bits under the overhearing source coding scheme.
To evaluate the proposed algorithms, we have resorted to a 3D modeling software to generate quasi-realistic city views for all cameras and we have used H.264 MVC reference software to encode collected images.
Evaluation results have shown that the proposed scheduling algorithm can outperform baseline approaches for resource-constrained multimedia M2M communications, thus motivating further investigation along this direction.
