\section{System Framework}
\label{sec::framework}
We now describe the system framework considered in our work.
First of all, we introduce the multi-camera network scenario and the clustered
communication model as well as the transmission process.
After that, we briefly illustrate the correlation between cameras and how we
exploit the correlation to reduce the usage of radio resource.
Finally, the rate-distortion model we used is also presented in this section.
