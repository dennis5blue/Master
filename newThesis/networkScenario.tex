As we mentioned in Chapter~\ref{sec::dcClustering}, we focus on the problem of transmission scheduling in a cluster for the sake of realizing the idea of correlated data gathering.
That is, we aim to determine the transmission schedule of each cluster so that the benefit of correlated data gathering can be maximized through the overhearing source coding.
Fig.~\ref{fig::sysModel} shows our target scenario by reduction from Fig.~\ref{fig::dcModel}, where the cluster heads in Fig.~\ref{fig::dcModel} is now considered as data aggregators in the following of this thesis.
Note that since we require ``lossless'' data delivery, each camera within the cluster is thus responsible to deliver its data to the aggregator once, and we also assume that each camera has the capability to overhear transmissions form nearby cameras that belong to the same cluster.
After a camera overhear nearby transmissions, it can apply the MVC mechanism as described in Chapter~\ref{sec::MultiviewIntro} for the sake of reducing the amount of data that is required to be delivered to the data aggregator (i.e. the serving cluster head of this camera).
In order to overhear the transmission from nearby cameras, it is clearly that the below two conditions must be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item The listener camera must be scheduled after the transmitter camera.
\item The listener camera must fall in the transmission range of the transmitter camera.
\end{itemize}
For example, suppose that camera $8$ in Fig.~\ref{fig::sysModel} is about to transmit its data to the aggregator, then only camera $7$ and $9$ can overhear the data of camera $8$ if and only if they are scheduled after camera $8$.
On the other hand, camera ${1,2,3,4,5,6,10}$ cannot overhear the transmission of camera $8$ no matter when they are scheduled since they fall outside the transmission of camera $8$.
We note that the position of each camera can be considered as the already known input information, therefore, the transmission range of each camera can also be pre-calculated.
Consequently, our goal in this thesis is to find a proper camera schedule such that the benefit of overhearing source coding can be maximized (i.e. the amount of reduced transmitted data is maximized).
Before starting formulating our problem, we first introduce some useful camera models in the following chapter.
