\section{Network Scenario and Data Model}
\label{sec::scenarioAndModel}
In this chapter, we present our target network scenario and related data models we used in this thesis.
More specifically, network scenario describes the data transmission scheme of one cluster under a given cluster structure, and related network models including the data correlation model of the multi-camera networks.
