\section{Network Scenario and Data Model}
\label{sec::scenarioAndModel}
In this chapter, we present our target network scenario and related data models we used in this thesis.
First of all, we will introduce the idea of data-centric clustering in multi-camera networks.
Then, we will show the network scenario we considered, which describes the data transmission scheme of one cluster under a given cluster structure.
Finally, related camera models including the camera sensing model and the camera correlation model are presented.
